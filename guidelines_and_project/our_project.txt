Scenario
We are commissioned by Rolling Stone, one of the most influential cultural magazines in the music industry, to create a data-
driven feature for their digital platform. The goal is to reveal the underlying structure of today’s most popular music on
Spotify — not through opinion or taste, but through data. As release dates are not included in the dataset, rather than
focusing on historical evolution this project will analyze the “Anatomy” of popular tracks on Spotify.

Rolling Stone’s editorial team envisions a visually rich, scroll-based
narrative — something that speaks to their curious, culture-aware, digitally
native readers, while keeping the visual tone aligned with their journalistic
aesthetic.

The final piece should blend statistical clarity with cultural storytelling,
helping readers not only see what defines a hit, but why it matters in
today’s algorithmic music landscape.
