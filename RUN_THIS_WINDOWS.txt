ANATOMY OF A HIT — RUN GUIDE (Windows)

What this is:
A small scrollytelling mini-website (HTML/CSS/JS) that visualizes our Spotify analysis results.
It runs locally in your browser (no installation besides Python).

1) Unzip
- Extract the ZIP anywhere (e.g., Desktop).
- You should see: index.html, css/, js/, data/, scripts/, README.md

2) Start the local server
- Open Command Prompt (CMD)
- Go into the extracted folder (the one that contains index.html):

  cd /d "FULL\PATH\TO\THE\PROJECT\FOLDER"

Example:
  cd /d "C:\Users\YOURNAME\Desktop\Project"

- Start the server:
  py -m http.server 8000

(If "py" doesn’t work, try:)
  python -m http.server 8000

3) Open the website
- Open your browser and go to:
  http://localhost:8000/index.html

4) Stop the server
- Go back to the CMD window and press:
  CTRL + C

Where to edit things:
- Visuals + charts: js/charts.js
- Scrollytelling logic + step switching: js/main.js
- Styling: css/style.css
- Data used by charts: data/processed/story.json

If something is blank:
- Open DevTools (F12) → Console and check for errors
- Make sure you opened it via localhost (NOT by double-clicking index.html)
