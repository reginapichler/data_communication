    <h1>Anatomy of a Hit</h1>
    <p class="dek">
      A scrollytelling deep-dive into Spotify's audio DNA: what "hit songs" look like, what genres signal,
      and how streaming culture quietly shapes the sound of success.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-intro">
      We analyzed 114,000 tracks from nearly 30,000 artists across 114 genres, using Spotify's audio features to understand what separates chart-toppers from the rest. Our main question: <strong>What makes a song a hit?</strong> Is it the tempo, the energy, the danceability? Or is there a hidden formula buried in the data? This story breaks down the patterns we found – not as a recipe for success, but as a map of how streaming culture shapes the music we hear.

        <h2>Cold Open</h2>
        <p class="step-question">What does success look like in the age of streaming?</p>
        <p>Three songs. Three different realities. Let's start by meeting them — before diving into the patterns that separate virality from obscurity.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">These examples show the range — now let's zoom out to see the full dataset.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="1">
        <h2>What Hits Sound Like</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Concrete differences, not causes</p>
        <p>Each dot is a real hit song. Where do they sit compared to the average Spotify track?</p>
        <p>Less instrumental. Louder. More danceable. Slightly shorter.</p>
        <p>This is sound—intuition before theory.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h2>The Core Hit Signature</h2>
        <p class="step-question">What separates hits from non-hits, on average?</p>
        <p>Across thousands of tracks, four features emerge: <strong>instrumentalness</strong> (strongest separator, Cohen's d = -0.36), <strong>loudness</strong> (d = 0.21), <strong>danceability</strong> (d = 0.22), and <strong>duration</strong> (d = -0.14).</p>
        <p>These show direction and relative strength — not exact values to copy. <em>(Hit = top 10% by Spotify popularity.)</em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h2>1) What makes a hit?</h2>
        <p class="step-question">What are we actually looking at when we talk about "hits" in this dataset?</p>
        <p>Start with context: what's in the dataset, and what do the "top" tracks look like?</p>
        <p class="step-transition">To see how exceptional hits really are, we first need to look at the full popularity spectrum.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <h2>2) The popularity spectrum</h2>
        <p class="step-question">How rare are hit songs compared with the long tail of releases?</p>
        <p>Popularity is not evenly distributed — most tracks live in the long tail.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">Now that we've seen the long tail, we can compare hits vs non-hits feature by feature.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="5">
        <h2>3.1) The "sound" profile</h2>
        <p class="step-question">How do mood and energy evolve as songs get more popular?</p>
        <p>How do danceability, energy, and valence change across the popularity spectrum?</p>
        <p class="step-transition">Sound alone isn't enough; structure in tempo and length also shapes how tracks perform.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="6">
        <h2>3.2) The "structure" profile</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Do shorter songs outperform longer ones in the streaming era?</p>
        <p><strong>Duration matters.</strong> Hits trend slightly shorter (3.6–3.9 min) — the "TikTok brain" effect is real but subtle.</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>Tempo is NOT a differentiator:</strong> All popularity bands (groups of songs by popularity score: 0-9, 10-19, ... 90-100) cluster tightly between 119–125 BPM. Tempo acts as a <em>constraint</em> (stay in the dance range), not a lever for success. The variance is too small to matter.
        </div>
        <p><em>Note: Each point represents the average tempo and duration for one popularity band (e.g., "80-89" = songs with popularity 80-89). Red points = top 20% bands (hits).</em></p>
        <p class="step-transition">Beyond structure, there's one more ingredient: language. Does profanity help or hurt?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="7">
        <h2>3.3) The power of profanity</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Is explicit content a barrier or a magnet for popularity?</p>
        <p>Explicit tracks (here, "hit" means top 10% by popularity) significantly outperform clean ones — both in average popularity and hit rate. The gap is clear: profanity is a magnet, not a barrier.</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>The verdict:</strong> Explicit tracks have a 16.9% hit rate vs 9.5% for non-explicit — nearly 80% higher. Average popularity is also 4.5 points higher (38.4 vs 33.9). This doesn't mean all hits swear, but it shows explicit content correlates with streaming success.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">Structure and language covered — now let's see if genre identity still shows up in the audio DNA.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="8">
        <h2>4) Genre fingerprints</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Are genres converging into a single "streaming sound," or do they retain distinct identities?</p>
        <p>We analyze 5 representative genres to see if their sonic fingerprints overlap or diverge. Each cell shows how far a genre deviates from the global average for a given feature.</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>How to read this:</strong> Bright, bordered cells = strong distinctiveness. Faded cells = convergence toward the average. Red = above average, Blue = below average. The verdict appears below the chart.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">If genres differ sonically, do they also differ in hit success?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="9">
        <h2>4.1) Genres & popularity</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Which genres overperform when it comes to producing hits?</p>
        <p>Which genres have higher average popularity (within the top genres by count)?</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>Answering the data question:</strong> How does popularity vary across different genres? Pop leads with an overrepresentation ratio of 6.4 in hits, followed by k-pop (4.4) and metal (4.2). This means these genres punch above their weight in the charts, while acoustic or blues tracks appear far less often among top hits than their share in the dataset would suggest.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">After genre winners, we can merge everything into a single "average hit" profile.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="10">
        <h2>5.1) Hit consistency vs diversity</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Do hits cluster around a narrow sound — or stay diverse?</p>
        <p>We compare feature variance in hits vs non-hits to see whether success correlates with homogeneity.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">And that profile doesn't just describe songs — it reflects how platforms and culture shape what rises.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="11">
        <h2>6) Why it matters: takeaway</h2>
        <p class="step-question">So what does this anatomy of a hit tell us about the culture of streaming?</p>
        <p>
          The headline is clear: hits cluster around a few audio traits (louder, more danceable, less instrumental),
          while tempo and length are far less decisive. Genres also carry distinct fingerprints and some consistently
          overperform in the hit zone. This isn't just sound science — it reflects how recommendation systems and
          platform incentives shape what rises. The tradeoff is real: optimizing for algorithmic signals can
          boost visibility, but it can also narrow diversity and flatten cultural variety.
        </p>
        <div class="step-callout">
          <strong>Pro/Culture takeaway:</strong> Use this as a map of platform influence, not a formula.
          Artists and listeners can choose when to optimize for reach — and when to protect diversity,
          experimentation, and cultural identity.

          <h3>Dataset Source</h3>
          <p>
            We analyzed <strong>114,000 tracks</strong> from the 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              Spotify Tracks Dataset (Kaggle)
            </a>, spanning nearly 30,000 artists across 114 genres. The dataset includes Spotify's proprietary 
            audio features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.) extracted via the Spotify Web API.
          </p>
          <p class="methodology-note">
            <strong>Timeframe:</strong> Dataset compiled in 2023. Track popularity reflects streaming data at that snapshot.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="methodology-item">
          <h3>Hit Definition</h3>
          <p>
            We define "hits" as tracks in the <strong>top 10% by popularity score</strong> (popularity ≥ 90th percentile). 
            This threshold is arbitrary but provides a consistent lens to compare high-performing tracks against 
            the broader catalog.
          </p>
          <p class="methodology-note">
            <strong>Threshold:</strong> Popularity score ≥ 61 (90th percentile).

          <h3>Audio Features</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Danceability:</strong> How suitable a track is for dancing (0.0–1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Perceptual intensity and activity (0.0–1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Valence:</strong> Musical positiveness/happiness (0.0–1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Loudness:</strong> Overall volume in decibels (dB)</li>
            <li><strong>Acousticness:</strong> Likelihood of being acoustic (0.0–1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentalness:</strong> Predicts lack of vocals (0.0–1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Speechiness:</strong> Presence of spoken words (0.0–1.0)</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="methodology-note">
            Features are computed by Spotify's audio analysis algorithms. See

          <h3>Statistical Methods</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Effect sizes:</strong> We use Cohen's d to measure standardized differences between 
            hit and non-hit groups. Values around 0.2 are considered small, 0.5 medium, 0.8 large.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Z-scores:</strong> Genre fingerprints show how many standard deviations each genre 
            deviates from the global mean for each feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Normalization:</strong> Some features (tempo, duration) are min-max normalized to 
            [0, 1] for visualization comparability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="methodology-item">
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <ul class="limitation-list">
            <li><strong>Correlation, not causation:</strong> Patterns show associations, not guarantees. 
            High danceability doesn't <em>cause</em> success—it correlates with it.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Platform bias:</strong> Popularity reflects Spotify's recommendation algorithms, 
            user demographics, and playlist curation—not universal musical quality.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Survivor bias:</strong> The dataset includes tracks already on Spotify. Unreleased, 
            rejected, or never-uploaded music isn't represented.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Genre ambiguity:</strong> Genre labels are crowd-sourced and inconsistent. 
            A track tagged "pop" might also fit "dance" or "indie."</li>
            
            <li><strong>Temporal snapshot:</strong> Popularity changes over time. A "hit" in 2023 might 
            fade by 2026, or a sleeper track might suddenly trend.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Reducing music to 10 numerical features omits lyrics, 
            cultural context, marketing, artist fame, and countless intangibles.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="methodology-item">
          <h3>Interpretation</h3>
          <p>
            This analysis is <strong>descriptive, not prescriptive</strong>. The "hit blueprint" maps 
            where streaming success has been—not where it must go. Artists can use these insights as 
            guideposts, not rules. Listeners can recognize algorithmic patterns while seeking diversity.
          </p>
