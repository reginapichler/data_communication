    <h1>Anatomy of a Hit</h1>
    <p class="dek">
      A scrollytelling deep-dive into Spotify's audio DNA: what "hit songs" look like, what genres signal,
      and how streaming culture quietly shapes the sound of success.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-intro">
      We analyzed 114,000 tracks from nearly 30,000 artists across 114 genres, using Spotify's audio features to understand what separates chart-toppers from the rest. Our main question: <strong>What makes a song a hit?</strong> Is it the tempo, the energy, the danceability? Or is there a hidden formula buried in the data? This story breaks down the patterns we found – not as a recipe for success, but as a map of how streaming culture shapes the music we hear.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-kicker">
      Start by listening to the top hit – then dive into the data behind what makes songs explode.

        <h2>1) What makes a hit?</h2>
        <p class="step-question">What are we actually looking at when we talk about “hits” in this dataset?</p>
        <p>Start with context: what’s in the dataset, and what do the “top” tracks look like?</p>
        <p class="step-transition">To see how exceptional hits really are, we first need to look at the full popularity spectrum.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="1">
        <h2>2) The popularity spectrum</h2>
        <p class="step-question">How rare are hit songs compared with the long tail of releases?</p>
        <p>Popularity is not evenly distributed — most tracks live in the long tail.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">Now that we’ve seen the long tail, we need a simple rule to define what counts as “hit” for the rest of the story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h2>2.1) Defining “hit”</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Where do we draw the line between a solid track and a true hit?</p>
        <p>We define hits as the top 10% by popularity (threshold shown below) + the key quantiles.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">With the gate set, we can compare hits vs non-hits feature by feature.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="chapter-break">
        <h2>From scarcity to sound</h2>
        <p>Now that we know how rare hits are, we can finally ask what they sound like.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h2>3) Feature-by-feature anatomy</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Which audio features most strongly distinguish hits from non-hits?</p>
        <p>Which audio features best separate high vs low popularity tracks?</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>Answering the data question:</strong> What are the most important audio features for predicting hit songs? Instrumentalness stands out with the strongest effect (Cohen's d = -0.36), showing hits are far less instrumental than low-popularity tracks. Loudness (d = 0.21) and danceability (d = 0.22) also play key roles, suggesting hits are louder and more danceable to capture attention in a crowded market.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">Those are overall gaps — next we trace how the same features change across the popularity ladder.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <h2>3.1) The “sound” profile</h2>
        <p class="step-question">How do mood and energy evolve as songs get more popular?</p>
        <p>How do danceability, energy, and valence change across the popularity spectrum?</p>
        <p class="step-transition">Sound alone isn’t enough; structure in tempo and length also shapes how tracks perform.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="5">
        <h2>3.2) The “structure” profile</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Are hits simply faster and shorter, or is the pattern more nuanced?</p>
        <p>Tempo and duration: are hits faster, shorter, or just different?</p>
        <p class="step-transition">Features describe songs, but genres describe context — let’s see if genre identity still shows up in the audio DNA.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="chapter-break">
        <h2>From sound to genre</h2>
        <p>If features explain the “what,” genres explain the context that shapes those sounds.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="step" data-step="6">
        <h2>4) Genre fingerprints</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Do genres still have unique sonic fingerprints in the streaming era?</p>
        <p>Do genres still sound different? A fingerprint view using z-scores per feature.</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>How to read this:</strong> Each cell shows how far a genre is above (red) or below (blue) the average for that feature. Darker color = stronger difference. Highlighted rows point to key genres for quick orientation.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">If genres differ sonically, do they also differ in hit success?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="7">
        <h2>4.1) Genres & popularity</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Which genres overperform when it comes to producing hits?</p>
        <p>Which genres have higher average popularity (within the top genres by count)?</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>Answering the data question:</strong> How does popularity vary across different genres? Pop leads with an overrepresentation ratio of 6.4 in hits, followed by k-pop (4.4) and metal (4.2). This means these genres punch above their weight in the charts, while acoustic or blues tracks appear far less often among top hits than their share in the dataset would suggest.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">After genre winners, we can merge everything into a single “average hit” profile.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="chapter-break">
        <h2>From genres to blueprint</h2>
        <p>We’ve mapped the context — now we combine signals into one hit profile.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="step" data-step="8">
        <h2>5) The hit blueprint</h2>
        <p class="step-question">What does the average hit look like when we merge all features into one profile?</p>
        <p>What does the “average hit” look like compared to the overall average?</p>
        <div class="data-answer">
          <strong>Building on the features:</strong> The hit blueprint reinforces which traits matter most. Hits differ notably in instrumentalness (-0.11 delta, less instrumental), loudness (+1.19, louder), and danceability (+0.04, more danceable). These aren't huge shifts, but in the scale of streaming, they can make the difference between obscurity and virality.
        </div>
        <p class="step-transition">But is success about convergence? Next we compare how consistent hits are versus the rest.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step" data-step="9">
        <h2>5.1) Hit consistency vs diversity</h2>
        <p class="step-question">Do hits cluster around a narrow sound — or stay diverse?</p>
        <p>We compare feature variance in hits vs non-hits to see whether success correlates with homogeneity.</p>
        <p class="step-transition">And that profile doesn’t just describe songs — it reflects how platforms and culture shape what rises.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="chapter-break">
        <h2>From patterns to meaning</h2>
        <p>Once the mechanics are clear, the cultural stakes come into view.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="step" data-step="10">
        <h2>6) Why it matters: takeaway</h2>
        <p class="step-question">So what does this anatomy of a hit tell us about the culture of streaming?</p>
        <p>
          The headline is clear: hits cluster around a few audio traits (louder, more danceable, less instrumental),
          while tempo and length are far less decisive. Genres also carry distinct fingerprints and some consistently
          overperform in the hit zone. This isn’t just sound science — it reflects how recommendation systems and
          platform incentives shape what rises. The tradeoff is real: optimizing for algorithmic signals can
          boost visibility, but it can also narrow diversity and flatten cultural variety.
        </p>
        <div class="step-callout">
          <strong>Pro/Culture takeaway:</strong> Use this as a map of platform influence, not a formula.
          Artists and listeners can choose when to optimize for reach — and when to protect diversity,
          experimentation, and cultural identity.
